    "1. The is_palindrome function takes an input string as its argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Within is_palindrome, we first remove spaces from the input string and convert it to lowercase. This step is optional but helps in handling cases where palindromes have different cases or spaces.\n",

    "\n",
    "Time Complexity: The time complexity of this code is `O(n)`, where 'n' is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate through the characters of the input string once to clean it and then compare it to its reverse, which also takes `O(n)` time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(n)`, where `'n'` is the length of the input string. This is because we create a cleaned version of the input string, which can have the same length as the original string in the worst case. Other than that, the code uses a constant amount of additional space for variables, so the overall space complexity is dominated by the cleaned string."

    "1. The get_permutations function takes an input string and initializes an empty list called permutations to store the generated permutations.\n",

    "3. In the generate_permutations function, we check if there are no remaining characters to permute. If so, we add the current permutation to the permutations list.\n",

    "5. Finally, we call generate_permutations with an empty current string and the input string, which initiates the recursive process.\n",
