    "1. The rod_cutting function takes two parameters: price (a list of prices for different rod lengths) and n (the length of the rod).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The function aims to find the maximum revenue that can be obtained by cutting the rod into different pieces and selling them according to their respective prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The function uses a Dynamic Programming approach to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. An array max_revenue is created to store the maximum revenue that can be obtained for rod lengths from 0 to n.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The value of max_revenue[0] is initialized to 0, as no revenue can be obtained from a rod of length 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The outer loop iterates through each rod length from 1 to n.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Inside the outer loop, an inner loop iterates through all possible cut lengths j from 1 to the current rod length i.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. For each cut length j, the function calculates the maximum revenue by adding the price of the piece cut at length j and the maximum revenue obtained from the remaining rod length i - j.\n",

    "9. The calculated maximum revenue value is updated in the variable max_val.\n",

    "10. After the inner loop completes, the maximum revenue for the current rod length i is stored in the max_revenue array at index i.\n",

    "The time complexity of the Dynamic Programming approach for the Rod Cutting problem is O(n^2), where n is the length of the rod.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each rod length i from 1 to n, we iterate through all possible cut lengths j from 1 to i. Therefore, the number of iterations is roughly proportional to 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n, which is proportional to n^2.\n",

    "1. The coin_change_top_down function takes three parameters: coins (a list of coin denominations), amount (the target amount), and memo (a memoization dictionary to store computed results for different amounts).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The function is designed to find the minimum number of coins needed to make the target amount using the given coin denominations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The function uses a recursive approach with memoization. It first checks if the solution for the given amount is already computed and stored in the memo dictionary. If it is, the precomputed result is returned directly, which helps avoid redundant calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The base case of the recursion is when amount is 0. In this case, no coins are needed, so the function returns 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If the solution for the current amount is not found in the memo dictionary, the function iterates through all available coin denominations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. For each coin denomination, the function checks if the amount is greater than or equal to the coin value. If it is, the function makes a recursive call with the reduced amount after subtracting the coin value. It also adds 1 to the result, as one more coin is added to the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The min_coins variable is used to track the minimum number of coins needed to make the current amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Once the loop completes, the minimum result is stored in the memo dictionary for the current amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Finally, the function returns the minimum number of coins needed for the given amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. In the example usage section, a list of coin denominations [1, 2, 5] and a target amount of 11 are provided. The memo dictionary is initialized as an empty dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. The coin_change_top_down function is called with the coin denominations, target amount, and memo dictionary. The result is stored in result_top_down.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. The minimum number of coins needed to make the target amount is printed as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of the Top-Down approach with memoization depends on the number of distinct subproblems that need to be solved. Since memoization prevents redundant calculations, the actual number of recursive calls is reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the time complexity with memoization is determined by the number of distinct amounts from 1 to the target amount and the number of available coin denominations. The worst-case time complexity with memoization is still exponential, specifically O(k^n), where k is the number of coin denominations and n is the target amount. However, due to memoization, the actual number of recursive calls is significantly reduced, leading to better performance compared to the naive recursive approach."

    "#### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The longest_common_subsequence function takes two parameters: text1 and text2.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The function aims to find the length of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between two given strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The function uses a Dynamic Programming approach to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A 2D array dp is initialized to store the lengths of the LCS for different prefixes of text1 and text2. The array has dimensions (m + 1) x (n + 1), where m is the length of text1 and n is the length of text2.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The outer loop iterates through each character of text1 (indexed from 1 to m).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Inside the outer loop, there's an inner loop that iterates through each character of text2 (indexed from 1 to n).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. For each pair of characters text1[i - 1] and text2[j - 1], the function checks if they are equal. If they are equal, the LCS length is incremented by 1   (dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1) because this character contributes to the common subsequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If the characters are not equal, the function updates the LCS length by taking the maximum of either excluding the current character from text1 (dp[i - 1][j]) or excluding the current character from text2 (dp[i][j - 1]).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The updated LCS length is stored in the dp array at index [i][j].\n",
    "\n",
    "10. After both loops complete, the final result is obtained from dp[m][n], which represents the length of the LCS for the entire strings text1 and text2.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. The function returns the calculated length of the LCS.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. In the example usage section, two strings \"abcde\" and \"ace\" are provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. The longest_common_subsequence function is called with these two strings. The length of the Longest Common Subsequence between the strings is printed as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of the Dynamic Programming approach for the Longest Common Subsequence problem is O(m * n), where m is the length of text1 and n is the length of text2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nested loops iterate through all combinations of characters in text1 and text2 once, and the calculations within the loops involve constant time operations (comparisons and additions). Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(m * n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming provides an efficient solution to the Longest Common Subsequence problem compared to naive recursive approaches, which could have exponential time complexity. The dynamic programming approach optimally solves the problem in polynomial time."
